User-friendly tool to clean and optimize databases. Efficiently manages large databases, simplifying repair and ensuring peak performance.

It works great with the latest WP and PHP versions and has an easy-to-use interface. For large tasks, it uses asynchronous requests to avoid errors and timeouts, ensuring smooth processing. Check it out at [Database Cleaner](https://meowapps.com/database-cleaner/).

**IMPORTANT**: Always back up your data before using this or any plugin! While Database Cleaner is reliable, it's always best to be safe. Better safe than sorry! :)

== Why another Database Cleaner? ==

While other database cleaners are available, my experience with them revealed areas for improvement, like outdated UIs, incomplete features, and limited data analysis capabilities. Most notably, they struggled with large databases. Motivated by these challenges, I developed my own solution. Now, I'm dedicated to refining it to suit all types of WordPress and databases, aiming to make it the best for everyone.

I'm open to feedback and would be thrilled to discuss how Database Cleaner can better meet your needs. Let's chat and enhance this tool together!

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin to WordPress.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to Meow Apps -> Database Cleaner in the sidebar and check the appropriate options.
4. Click on the button to clean your database automatically.
